This web app makes use of the Giphy API to populate gifs and html elements to the web page.

The user can click the existing buttons on the page, which will then populate GIFs from Giphy, or decide to search for another topic of GIFs. This search will then populate a button onto the page.

The purpose of this app is to get more familiar with APIs and using jQuery to append elements to the DOM.

This web app was created with HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
